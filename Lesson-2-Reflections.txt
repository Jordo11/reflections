What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1) Intializing a repository lets Git know where you would like to store the 
commits and commit related files

2) You need to initialize a repository or Git will not know which files you
would like to use its commands on

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

1) The staging area allows one more layer of confirmation before commiting your file to the repository

2) The staging area is in between the repository and the working directory, and
any files you put there will not be moved to the repository until you commit them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

1) You can compare the staged version of your file, or files, to the last commit
and make sure you are not adding too much or too little at a time.
