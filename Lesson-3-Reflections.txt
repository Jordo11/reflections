When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1) When there are multiple people working from different computers on the same project.

2) When you would like to provide a simple way for the public to have access to your code

3) If you are personally working from more than one machine and want a simple way to have
access to the files on both

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1) You may not always want the changes made to the remote repository on your machine
until you are ready for them

2) Git pulling changes automatically may pull changes that you did not want in
your local version
