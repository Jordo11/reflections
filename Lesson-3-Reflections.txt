When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1) When there are multiple people working from different computers on the same project.

2) When you would like to provide a simple way for the public to have access to your code

3) If you are personally working from more than one machine and want a simple way to have
access to the files on both

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1) You may not always want the changes made to the remote repository on your machine
until you are ready for them

2) Git pulling changes automatically may pull changes that you did not want in
your local version

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

1) Forks are good if you would like to clone the remote repository as well as
push changes to it but you do not have access to change the original repo.

2) Cloning is useful for when you do not need use the remote repository but still
get it onto your local machine. 

3) If you have made a local repository and plan to keep it local, you can use
branches to store experimental versions of your files seperate from master.

4) When a repository is forked onto your account it becomes your repository and
any changes made to it do not affect the original. A fork also credits the 
original creator of the repository.
